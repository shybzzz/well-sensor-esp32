# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Well-Sensor ESP32 - Check Build

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request

    branches: [combined-sensor]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
